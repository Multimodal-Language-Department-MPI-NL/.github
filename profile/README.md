# Multimodal Language Department â€“ MPI for Psycholinguistics

We study how visible bodily signals (hands, face, body posture) coordinate with speech to form multimodal language. Our work spans corpora, experimental design, computational modeling, and kinematic / gesture analysis.

## code for Kinematic Analytics

Below are core code modules maintained by our department that support general kinematic analyses of gestures/signs. Each repository is designed to be installable and runnable on its own.

| Module | Purpose | Repository |
|---|---|---|
| [Extracting MediaPipe keypoints](https://github.com/Multimodal-Language-Department-MPI-NL/MediaPipe_keypoints_extraction) | Extract MediaPipe keypoints from video data | `gesture-keypoints` |
| [Smoothing](https://github.com/Multimodal-Language-Department-MPI-NL/Smoothing) | Temporal filtering / smoothing of raw motion time series | `gesture-smoothing` |
| [Normalization](https://github.com/Multimodal-Language-Department-MPI-NL/Normalization) | Scaling, alignment, normalization across participants / sessions | `gesture-normalization` |
| [Merging ELAN and MediaPipe](https://github.com/Multimodal-Language-Department-MPI-NL/Merging_Motion_ELAN) | Merge synchronization of ELAN annotations with pose/face/hands data | `gesture-merge` |
| [Speed, Acceleration, and Jerk](https://github.com/Multimodal-Language-Department-MPI-NL/Speed_Acceleration_Jerk) | Compute derivatives of motion: velocity, acceleration, jerk | `gesture-kinematics` |
| [Submovements and Holds](https://github.com/Multimodal-Language-Department-MPI-NL/Submovements_Holds) | Detect movement segments, pauses, hold events | `gesture-submovements` |
| [Gesture Space, Size, and Volume](https://github.com/Multimodal-Language-Department-MPI-NL/Gesture_Space_Size_and_Volume) | Dimensionality reduction / embedding of gesture trajectories | `gesture-space` |
| [Heatmap Visualization](https://github.com/Multimodal-Language-Department-MPI-NL/Heatmap) | Plot heatmaps, grids, visual summaries of gesture metrics | `gesture-heatmap` |
